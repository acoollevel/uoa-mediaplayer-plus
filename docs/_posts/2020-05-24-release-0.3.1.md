A small update that fixes a few annoying issues.

## Changes

- Pressing the spacebar or arrow keys should now work 100% of the time
- The width of the action popup has been increased to prevent text from being cut off in Firefox

That's all really. Drop us a line in the Discord if you have encountered any other issues. We will probably be focusing on new features next.

## A quick update on stats

As mentioned before, the only statistics we collect at the moment are those provided by the Chrome Web Store. So far, over 300 people have downloaded the extension, with new people adding it to their browser every day.

## Future development

There are a few ideas floating around for new features to be added. One thing is automatically redirecting from the old player, which seems to only happen for some of the recordings. I am still looking for the best way to do this.

Seek previews are also still in the works. Other than that I am open for suggestions.
